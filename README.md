## üìö About This Repository

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Computing repository! This is where I document my journey through AWS Academy labs and preparation for AWS certification exams. The repository contains lab work, notes, project implementations, and certification study materials.

My goal is to master AWS cloud services and achieve cloud certification, demonstrating my ability to architect and implement robust cloud solutions.

## üîß AWS Academy Labs

This section includes my completed lab work from the AWS Academy program, featuring hands-on exercises in:

- **EC2 & Compute Services**
- **Storage Solutions (S3, EBS, EFS)**
- **Database Services (RDS, DynamoDB)**
- **Networking (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups)**
- **Serverless Computing (Lambda, API Gateway)**
- **Container Services (ECS, EKS)**
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- **Monitoring & Management (CloudWatch, CloudTrail)**

Each lab directory contains detailed documentation of the implementation process, challenges encountered, and solutions developed.

## üìù Certification Notes

Comprehensive study notes organized by AWS certification domains:

- **Cloud Concepts**
- **Security & Compliance**
- **Technology**
- **Billing & Pricing**

These notes include key concepts, best practices, architectural patterns, and exam tips to aid in certification preparation.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects

Real-world projects implemented on AWS to demonstrate practical application of cloud services:

- **Three-Tier Web Application Architecture**
- **Serverless Data Processing Pipeline**
- **Highly Available WordPress Deployment**
